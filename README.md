## Notes

Data in segmented form were slightly adjusted from the original, by correcting some cases which we assumed to be typos and also by modifying the representation of what was judged as one and what was judged as two sounds. Data should be taken with some care at this point, since we still wait for a complete phonological analysis of the language.
